# The Plain Contract


## Description

Every freelancer should have their own contract. Working without one can lead to disagreements, misunderstandings, lost money and even legal action. Yet many freelancers that do have a contract still don’t fully understand what they’re agreeing to, because the contract template they’re using is riddled with tongue-tying legalese and isn’t tailored to their situation.

[The Plain Contract](https://plainfreelancecontract.com?utm_source=GitHub) was created to solve this problem. It's a crowdsourced, open source standard, written with the help of thousands of freelancers around the world and continually updated and improved.
